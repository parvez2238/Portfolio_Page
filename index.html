                    Instsgram_Clone with DevOps Workflow</h3>
                <p><a href="https://github.com/parvez2238/Instagram_Clone" target="_blank"><h4>GitHub :</h4>https://github.com/parvez2238/Instagram_Clone</a></p>
                <li>As a passionate developer, I embarked on a journey to create an Instagram clone using the power of Flutter for the frontend and Google Firebase for backend support. This project not only aimed to replicate the popular social media platform but also served as a learning ground for DevOps practices.
                    <h5>Key Achievements:</h5>
                     Seamless Version Control: Integrated Git and GitHub into the project, allowing for effortless code management. With a single command, I could push, pull, or create branches, streamlining collaboration with my team.
                     Containerization with Docker: Containerized the application using Docker, ensuring consistency and reproducibility across different environments. This facilitated easy setup and development on local machines.
                     Jenkins CI/CD Pipeline: Implemented a robust Jenkins CI/CD pipeline that automated the build, testing, and deployment processes. The Docker image, once built, was exposed on a local testing node or server, enabling rapid iterations.
                     Production-Ready Deployment: Leveraged ngrok to securely expose my local system to Amazon Web Services (AWS) EC2 instances. By creating a Jenkins node as a production server, I ensured a scalable and resilient deployment.
                   <h5> Outcome:</h5>
                    This project not only honed my Flutter and Firebase development skills but also equipped me with valuable DevOps experience. It highlighted my ability to create end-to-end solutions, from code management to production deployment, following modern best practices.
                    This Instagram clone project embodies my commitment to continuous learning, innovation, and the pursuit of excellence in software development and DevOps practices. It's a testament to my dedication to creating robust, scalable, and efficient solutions.</li>
